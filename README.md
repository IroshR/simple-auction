# Simple Auction Project

The Simple Auction is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates the auction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using the ERC721 standard. It allows users to list their NFTs for auction, accept bids from other participants, and transfer ownership of the NFT to the highest bidder at the end of the auction.
